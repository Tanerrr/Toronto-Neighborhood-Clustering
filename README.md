# Toronto-Neighborhood-Clustering


In this project, I explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.

You can examine getting a DataFrame from an ordinary Wikipedia table by using **read_html** function of Pandas. 

In addition, the neighborhood in Toronto were visualized using the **folium** library.

Finally, using the **k-means** clustering algorithm, Toronto neighborhood segments were divided into 4 different clusters.
