# Toronto-Neighborhood-Clustering
Toronto Neighborhood Clustering

In this project, I explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.

You can examine getting a DataFrame from an ordinary Wikipedia table by using <h3>read_html</h3> function of Pandas. 

In addition, the neighborhood in Toronto were visualized using the <h3>folium</h3> library.

Finally, using the <h3>k-means</h3> clustering algorithm, Toronto neighborhood segments were divided into 4 different clusters.
